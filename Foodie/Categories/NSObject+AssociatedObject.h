//You probably want to do this in the dealloc method of your class as well.
//if the underlying implementation implements dealloc, you have two choices
//1.  make sure that you call [self setObjectAssociatedWithInstance:nil] at
//    the appropriate point in your code.
//2.  swizzle dealloc and ensure that this happens.

//========================================
//alternate implementation using retain.  object deallocated on dealloc
